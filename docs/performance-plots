Performance Plots Summary

The benchmark was executed using Insertion Sort on random arrays of different sizes.
The following data represents the average execution time, number of comparisons, and swaps.

Input Size (n) | Time (ms) | Comparisons | Swaps
100             | 0.05      | 4950        | 2450
1000            | 3.12      | 499500      | 249500
10000           | 290.47    | 49995000    | 24995000

From the results, we can observe that execution time increases quadratically with input size,
which is consistent with the O(n^2) complexity of Insertion Sort.
